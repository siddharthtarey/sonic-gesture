## About ##
Sonic Gesture is a Computer Vision project where learned hand poses are translated into corresponding commands with the aim of generating sound. In other words this software makes it possible to create and manipulating sound without physical interaction with a computer.

This is the graduation project of [Gijs Molenaar](http://gijs.pythonic.nl) for the Master Artificial Intelligence at the [University of Amsterdam](http://www.uva.nl). You can read [the thesis](http://sonic-gesture.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/thesis/thesis-small.pdf) if you want.
